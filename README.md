# üéØ THE FINALS FOV Aim ‚Äì Control Your Aim Like a God

**Only Lock Targets Within Your Chosen Field of View ‚Äì Stay Smooth, Stay Safe**

If you want **legit aim that doesn‚Äôt snap or scream cheat**, you need **FOV Aim**‚Äîa clean and controllable way to boost accuracy in **THE FINALS** without triggering spectate suspicions or unfair play calls.

FOV Aim limits your aim assistance to a custom ‚Äúbubble‚Äù or cone in front of your crosshair. Inside that space, it will **soft lock**, **track**, or **pull toward targets**‚Äîbut never beyond. That means no wild flicks, no suspicious 180s, and no aimbot-style snaps. Just **realistic, buttery-smooth aim** that feels human but performs elite üî´üß†
